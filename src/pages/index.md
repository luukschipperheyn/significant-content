      # Depths of Wikipedia


      ![Annie Rauwerda of Depths of Wikipedia](/img/annie_dow.png)


      Bored during the pandemic Annie Rauwerda started her Instagram page ‚ÄúDepths of Wikipedia‚Äù in April of 2020. Although originally intended to share strange, surprising, and interesting facts from the English Wikipedia among friends, the page has grown over a million followers. Annie made a Twitter page, where the Wikipedia screenshots get posted as well. On TikTok she uses the @depthsofwikipedia handle to post personal stories, facts about Wikipedia, comedic videos and updates on her¬†[perpetual stew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_stew).¬†

      # Fashionlover4


      ![Michael of Fashionlover4](/img/ig_hni-03.png)


      Michael, aka Fashionlover4 or @hotfashiontakes, has an interest in fashion, but is also critical of the fashion world. On TikTok he posts short and snappy videos like tier lists, and explainer videos on topics like a specific garment or the history of a brand or designer. On his YouTube channel he posts longer video-essays that go more in-depth and visually often have a livestream-like composition where a green screen video of Michael is placed in a bottom corner on top of archival video footage.¬†

          Somi Lynda, [@driplist](https://www.tiktok.com/@driplist), moved from
          Nigeria to the Netherlands a couple of years ago. She uses surprising
          situations she found herself in, in her new country of residence to
          make TikTok videos. Using the platform's formats and tools she shows
          Dutch habits and aspects of the culture natives might not even realize
          they participate in.

          The page of Sophie Browning, <a
          href="https://www.instagram.com/joan.of.arca"
          target="blank">@joan.of.arca</a>, is a shitposting Instagram account
          that, as the name suggests, has a focus on pop star Arca and their
          music, as well as related artists. Ms. Of Arca also regularly posts
          references to themselves and other befriended meme pages.

          Stefan Li, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thesushidragon"
          target="blank">@TheSushiDragon</a>, is active on Twitch. His streams
          look like video performances in which he is constantly flipping
          between different cameras, applying video and sound effects in an
          incredibly high pace and all in real time using a custom suit full of
          buttons and toggles. In his own words he is ‚Äúexploiting technology to
          inject realtime imaginative content.‚Äù

          The Instagram meme page <a
          href="https://www.instagram.com/this.and.a.blunt"
          target="blank">@this.and.a.blunt</a> could be considered a so-called
          "shitposting" account. The images uploaded to the page seem random and
          aimless. They don't really have a punchline, but are humorous
          nonetheless. The pictures and videos are nearly always screenshots or
          screenrecordings from other places, resulting in a chaotic reflection
          of the online zeitgeist.

    text: Significant Content
  - body: >-
      Content creators on social media are usually not approached like film
      directors, musicians or designers, while these creators make an important
      contribution to our daily media consumption and (digital) culture. In the
      Significant Content event series, popular creators on various social media
      platforms are offered an artist talk.


      Just as a significant figure in mathematics can make a difference in a calculation, the content of these creators can make a difference within the framework of a social media platform and reveal medium-specific characteristics of this platform. These creators often deploy very clever tactics that make their content work well within the medium they are using. By outlining the content and methods of these creators we unravel how social media platforms work beneath the surface.


      Significant Content was initiated by [Sjef van Beers](http://sjefvanbeers.com) and [Florian van Zandwijk](http://www.florianvanzandwijk.nl/) and is made possible by the Creative Industries Fund NL.
