      The Instagram meme page [@this.and.a.blunt](https://www.instagram.com/this.and.a.blunt) could be considered a so-called "shitposting" account. The images uploaded to the page seem random and aimless. They don't really have a punchline, but are humorous nonetheless. The pictures and videos are nearly always screenshots or screenrecordings from other places, resulting in a chaotic reflection of the online zeitgeist.

      Content creators on social media are usually not approached like film
      directors, musicians or designers, while these creators make an important
      contribution to our daily media consumption and (digital) culture. In the
      Significant Content event series, popular creators on various social media
      platforms are offered an artist talk.


      Just as a significant figure in mathematics can make a difference in a calculation, the content of these creators can make a difference within the framework of a social media platform and reveal medium-specific characteristics of this platform. These creators often deploy very clever tactics that make their content work well within the medium they are using. By outlining the content and methods of these creators, meanwhile, it unravels how social media platforms work beneath the surface.


      Significant Content was initiated by Sjef van Beers and Florian van Zandwijk. Significant Content is made possible by the Creative Industries Fund NL.
