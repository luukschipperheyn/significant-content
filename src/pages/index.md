          Somi Lynda, [@driplist](https://www.tiktok.com/@driplist), moved from
          Nigeria to the Netherlands a couple of years ago. She uses surprising
          situations she found herself in, in her new country of residence to
          make TikTok videos. Using the platform's formats and tools she shows
          Dutch habits and aspects of the culture natives might not even realize
          they participate in.

          Stefan Li, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thesushidragon"
          target="blank">@TheSushiDragon</a>, is active on Twitch. His streams
          look like video performances in which he is constantly flipping
          between different cameras, applying video and sound effects in an
          incredibly high pace and all in real time using a custom suit full of
          buttons and toggles. In his own words he is “exploiting technology to
          inject realtime imaginative content.”

      Content creators on social media are usually not approached like film
      directors, musicians or designers, while these creators make an important
      contribution to our daily media consumption and (digital) culture. In the
      Significant Content event series, popular creators on various social media
      platforms are offered an artist talk.


      Just as a significant figure in mathematics can make a difference in a calculation, the content of these creators can make a difference within the framework of a social media platform and reveal medium-specific characteristics of this platform. These creators often deploy very clever tactics that make their content work well within the medium they are using. By outlining the content and methods of these creators, meanwhile, it unravels how social media platforms work beneath the surface.


      Significant Content was initiated by [Sjef van Beers](http://sjefvanbeers.com) and [Florian van Zandwijk](http://www.florianvanzandwijk.nl/). Significant Content is made possible by the Creative Industries Fund NL.
