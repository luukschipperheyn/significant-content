      # James Rehwald


      ![](/img/jamescopy.jpg)


      Through fast-paced videos with lots of video effects and added text and graphics, James Rehwald shares his take on American and international politics. The abundance of references creates the feeling that his videos are well researched, but combined with the fast-paced editing style, it also contributes to the comedy that plays a large role in his videos. As a creator of content that does not conform to the political status quo, James has had to deal with videos and accounts being (shadow) banned in recent years.\

      # Defunctland


      ![](/img/defunctland-icon.jpeg)


      In 2017 Kevin Perjurer started making a video series on a VR project he started where was creating a virtual theme park consisting of various demolished attractions called Defunctland. Even though the VR project still exists, as a community project now, Kevin has made Defunctland into a popular YouTube channel. In his videos he maps¬†out the history of vanished theme parks and attractions. Eventually he branched out to include broader pop culture topics too such as TV shows and fast food chains.\

          Somi Lynda, [@driplist](https://www.tiktok.com/@driplist), moved from
          Nigeria to the Netherlands a couple of years ago. She uses surprising
          situations she found herself in, in her new country of residence to
          make TikTok videos. Using the platform's formats and tools she shows
          Dutch habits and aspects of the culture natives might not even realize
          they participate in.

        body: >-
          Michael, aka Fashionlover4 or @hotfashiontakes, has an interest in
          fashion, but is also critical of the fashion world. On TikTok he posts
          short and snappy videos like tier lists, and explainer videos on
          topics like a specific garment or the history of a brand or designer.
          On his YouTube channel he posts longer video-essays that go more
          in-depth and visually often have a livestream-like composition where a
          green screen video of Michael is placed in a bottom corner on top of
          archival video footage.¬†

          Hoog started out as a YouTube-channel posting video essays about design. The video essay genre is one of the most prominent on the platform. Hoog essays maintain a consistent style, with 3D animation as one of its more distinctive elements and the use of genre defining elements such as archival footage, musical elements and voice over. Lately, Hoog started a joint venture with Simplicissimus as Fern, a new YouTube-channel where they post ‚Äúarmchair documentaries‚Äù in a similar style, but on a wider variety of topics, from McDonalds packaging to how The Netherlands should be considered a giant city. Only two years in, Hoog and Fern video‚Äôs clearly resonate with the YouTube audience, having passed a total of thirty million views to date.

          MJ Corey interprets the online and televised presence of
          Kardashian-Jenner family members using media theory. After starting
          [Kardashian
          Kolloquium](https://www.instagram.com/kardashian_kolloquium/) on
          Instagram, where she would write captions to accompany screenshots of
          Keeping Up with the Kardashians and post self-made memes, she branched
          out to [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@mjcoreywrites) and
          [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@kardashian_kolloquium) to make
          video content as well. MJ also wrote pieces for outlets like the New
          Yorker and Vogue and is currently working on her first book.

          Stefan Li, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thesushidragon"
          target="blank">@TheSushiDragon</a>, is active on Twitch. His streams
          look like video performances in which he is constantly flipping
          between different cameras, applying video and sound effects in an
          incredibly high pace and all in real time using a custom suit full of
          buttons and toggles. In his own words he is ‚Äúexploiting technology to
          inject realtime imaginative content.‚Äù

          The Instagram meme page <a
          href="https://www.instagram.com/this.and.a.blunt"
          target="blank">@this.and.a.blunt</a> could be considered a so-called
          "shitposting" account. The images uploaded to the page seem random and
          aimless. They don't really have a punchline, but are humorous
          nonetheless. The pictures and videos are nearly always screenshots or
          screenrecordings from other places, resulting in a chaotic reflection
          of the online zeitgeist.

    text: Significant Content
  - body: >-
      Content creators on social media are usually not approached like film
      directors, musicians or designers, while these creators make an important
      contribution to our daily media consumption and (digital) culture. In the
      Significant Content event series, popular creators on various social media
      platforms are offered an artist talk.


      Just as a significant figure in mathematics can make a difference in a calculation, the content of these creators can make a difference within the framework of a social media platform and reveal medium-specific characteristics of this platform. These creators often deploy very clever tactics that make their content work well within the medium they are using. By outlining the content and methods of these creators we unravel how social media platforms work beneath the surface.


      Significant Content was initiated by [Sjef van Beers](http://sjefvanbeers.com) and [Florian van Zandwijk](http://www.florianvanzandwijk.nl/) and is made possible by the Creative Industries Fund NL.
